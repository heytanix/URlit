# URlit
URlit is a short program in Python to shorten URLs that are long (via TinyURL)

As you start the script a line appears as below:
"Enter the url to shorten it: <Long URL>" (Here "Long URL" is the long url you have obtined from a browser directly or got it from elsewhere)
[This is where the longe URL has to be entered]

Once you have entered the longer URL and proceeded, a line will appear as follows:
"Short url:  <Shortened URL>" (Here "<Shortened URL>" is the custom URL you get after it has been shortened)
[This is where you get the shortened URL]
